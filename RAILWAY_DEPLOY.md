## Quick Deploy Methods

### 1. üñ±Ô∏è Manual Deploy (Recommended)
The easiest way to deploy:

1. Visit [Your Project Dashboard](https://railway.com/project/42a0fb07-6c26-400d-bfd2-81fbbf03a5fc)
2. Go to your service deployment page
3. Click **"Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"** button
4. Railway will automatically pull the latest code from GitHub
5. Monitor deployment logs for any issues

### 2. ü§ñ Automated Script Deploy
Run the deployment script:

```bash
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

**Note:** This requires Railway CLI authentication which may not work in all environments.

### 3. üìã Manual CLI Deploy
If you need to use Railway CLI manually:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh

# Login to Railway (requires browser)
railway login

# Link to your specific project
railway link --project 42a0fb07-6c26-400d-bfd2-81fbbf03a5fc

# Deploy
railway up
```

## Environment Variables
Your Railway project should have these environment variables set:

```bash
GOOGLE_SOLAR_API_KEY=AIzaSyB0kDcpY2spi-xXkWTvPdWFImAnu9aDDYc
NODE_ENV=production
```

To check/set them:
```bash
railway variables
railway variables set VARIABLE_NAME="value"
```

## Deployment Configuration

### railway.json
The project uses this Railway configuration:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start"
  }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **No build step** - Uses vanilla JS (no Vite build)
- **Start command:** `npm start` runs server.js
- **Auto-deploys** from GitHub main branch
- **Port:** Railway automatically assigns PORT environment variable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Map/Search not working:**
- Check if script.js is loading properly
- Verify server.js serves static files correctly
- Look for console errors in browser

**2. API errors:**
- Verify GOOGLE_SOLAR_API_KEY is set
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`

**3. Deployment fails:**
- Check GitHub Actions are passing
- Verify railway.json configuration
- Review Railway build logs

**4. CLI authentication fails:**
- Use manual dashboard deployment instead
- Ensure you're logged in: `railway login`
- Check project linking: `railway status`

### Commands for Debugging:

```bash
# Check project status
railway status

# View deployment logs
railway logs

# Check environment variables
railway variables

# Get project URL
railway domain
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

After successful deployment:

1. ‚úÖ **Test the live URL:** https://shimmering-cooperation-production.up.railway.app
2. ‚úÖ **Verify map loads** - Check Leaflet map appears
3. ‚úÖ **Test search functionality** - Try searching for an address
4. ‚úÖ **Check console** - No JavaScript errors
5. ‚úÖ **Test API endpoints** - Solar data requests work
6. ‚úÖ **Mobile responsive** - Test on different screen sizes

üí° **Pro Tip:** Railway auto-deploys from GitHub, so simply pushing to main branch should trigger a deployment. Use the manual dashboard method if CLI fails.
